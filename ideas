magic:
possession: you cast on rat, circle opens of rats view, you control rat instead of yourself. rat can go under all doors. rat can't use portals and stuff
recall: you leave a recall point anywhere. you can recall at anytime but it takes a while (strictly for out of battle). while "recalled" you can't move but you can use items. also you're still where you recalled from (you can get hit there). its for filling up potions instead of backtracking.
