Driven by the mysteries of magic, you've sped through the ranks of the Guild of Wizards, managing to achieve the title of "Master Wizard." While studying in the library, you find the book: "The Endless Door of Wizards." Other wizards in the guild find this book to be absurd, often rambling or making no sense what-so-ever, but you obsess over it. You believe there to be a code, hidden among the ramblings, and though your colleages warn you against pursuit, you are determined to decipher it. Hours turn to days and days to weeks as you furiously scribble notes and copy pages from the book. You completely ignore guild duties and your interactions with the other Wizards consist only of your manic ramblings of the book. A trial is held for your expulsion from the guild. Seeing this as your chance to explain your work and your plan, you attend. Your explaination is disjointed and insane, explaining that a tome of a powerful ancient spell lies hidden underground in the far north. Before you are officially stripped of your rank, you run out of the forum, leaving the Guild entirely. You follow your crazed scribblings north, and when you finally find the cave entrance, you feel an overwhelming sense of vidication. Stepping into the cave, you light your torch, wondering... will your mad prophecies lead you to glory or death?
